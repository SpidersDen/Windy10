# Evn08's Windows Utility

This Utility is a compilation of windows tasks I perform on each Windows system I use. It is meant to streamline *installs*, debloat with *tweaks*, troubleshoot with *config*, and fix Windows *updates*. I am extremely picky on any contributions to keep this project clean and efficient.

Requires you to launch PowerShell or Windows Terminal As ADMINISTRATOR! 

The recommended way is to right click on the start menu and select (PowerShell As Admin *Windows 10* - Windows Terminal As Admin *Windows 11*)

Launch Command:

```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol=[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12;iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evn08/Windy10/main/winutil.ps1')
```
If you are having issues try changing your DNS provider to 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8
